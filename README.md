##### This is an [Android Experiment](http://androidexperiments.com).

This is an Android Wear watch face designed and developed by B-Reel in collaboration with the renowned Craig Ward.

Working closely with typographer and designer Craig Ward, this watch face is an experiment in taking his process-driven style into a brand new digital medium. It uses shadows, light and tone along with custom designed numerals to reveal the time. Taking inspiration from sundials, the face transitions from day into night with light and shadows shifting over the course of 24 hours.

Craig Ward, Creative Director of Fatale, is globally known for his pioneering typographic work under the Words Are Pictures moniker.
